Journal Reflection

How do I approach designing software
Working on this project helped me improve my ability to break down a visual concept into smaller, code-based components. I learned how to design scenes with intentional use of space, lighting, and camera positioning. My design process began by visualizing a warm and organized workspace. From there, I made layout sketches and translated those into OpenGL shapes and textures. I used a mix of planning and testing to refine the final look. The iterative planning and layout skills I practiced here can be useful in any software project that requires thoughtful visual or structural design.

How do I approach developing programs
During development, I used a modular strategy where each object was built and tested individually. I applied transformations like scaling, translation, and rotation in careful order to achieve the intended composition. I also experimented with lighting and textures to create realistic effects. Iteration played a major role as I continuously refined the scene by testing lighting angles, adjusting camera movement, and optimizing object placement. As the milestones progressed, I became more comfortable organizing code across multiple classes and functions. This helped me build more reusable and maintainable code, especially for drawing and managing mesh objects.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals
This project showed me how computational graphics can be used to create immersive environments, something that is valuable in many areas of technology. I gained new technical skills that I can apply in future courses related to simulations, game design, or virtual environments. Professionally, this experience strengthens my ability to build and troubleshoot visual systems that may be used in automation, training simulations, or digital design. It adds another tool to my engineering and software development background by helping me bridge creativity and technical execution.
